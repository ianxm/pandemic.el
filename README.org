* Pandemic
** Overview

[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] is a text editor.  An extensible one.  It is mainly used for
coding, but it can also do anything else.

[[https://github.com/ianxm/pandemic.el][pandemic.el]] is meant to be used while playing the [[https://www.zmangames.com/en/games/pandemic/][pandemic board
game]].  It helps keep track of which cities are most likely to be
infected in the next few turns.

Here is a screenshot.  The "Turn 1" column gives the probability any
city will be chosen on the next turn.  "Turn 2" is for the following
turn, and so on.

** Usage

*** Keys

- @@html:<kbd>@@r@@html:</kbd>@@ :: reset the buffer for a new game
- @@html:<kbd>@@i@@html:</kbd>@@ :: infect a city
- @@html:<kbd>@@e@@html:</kbd>@@ :: mark off that there was an epidemic

*** How To

Open pandemic.org.  It should put itself in pandemic mode, which
provides the above key bindings.

Hit @@html:<kbd>@@r@@html:</kbd>@@ to reset the buffer to play a new game.

Each time a new card is drawn from the infection deck, hit
@@html:<kbd>@@i@@html:</kbd>@@ and enter the city.  If you use an
completion package such as ivy or ido then you'll only have to type a
few key strokes.

Each time an epidemic card is drawn hit @@html:<kbd>@@e@@html:</kbd>@@.

That's it.
